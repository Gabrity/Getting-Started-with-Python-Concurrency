Concurrency is the execution of multiple instruction sequences at the same time.
In concurrent programming, the order of execution of these instrucion sequences should not have an effect on the outcome.

The different executions should shared as less resources as possible.

Two types exist in python:
1. Paralell programming
2. Async programming

1. Is splitting a task into multiple ones and assigning them to different processor cores. This is good for cpu bound tasks. 
2. For I/O bound operations async programming is best. It works by delegating a task to another actor and continue the work. 
When the actor is finised, it calls a method that notifies the main thread that can handle the results from then on (callback function).
In some languanges, instead of callback an object is created that represents the results of the task.
